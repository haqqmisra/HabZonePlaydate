# Habitable Zone Calculator for Playdate
This is a Playdate application that calculates the inner and outer boundaries of the liquid water habitable zone (HZ) for planetary systems.

The liquid water habitable zone (sometimes called the "Goldilocks Zone") is the region around a star where an Earth-like planet could sustain liquid water on its surface. The inner edge of the HZ is the orbital distance where an Earth-like planet would enter a runaway greenhouse and be too warm to sustain a liquid water ocean. The outer edge of the HZ is the orbital distance where a planet is too hot to sustain liquid water (because it enters a runaway greenhouse state). The inner edge of the HZ is th orbital distance where a planet is too cold to sustain liquid water (because it reaches the maximum greenhouse effect where no additional amount of carbon dioxide can keep the planet warm). These limits are based on the exoplanet climate model simulations performed by Kopparapu et al. ([2013](http://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/765/2/131), [2014](http://doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/787/2/L29)).
